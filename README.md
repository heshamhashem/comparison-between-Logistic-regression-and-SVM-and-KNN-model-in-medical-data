# comparison-between-Logistic-regression-and-SVM-and-KNN-model-in-medical-data
# In this project, you will learn practically how to choose the best features that help us to identify Medical Diagnosis of diabetes using Data analysis &amp; data visualization and then using these features in logistic regression  , SVM  and KNN models .    We will go through 5 tasks to implement our project:  Task 1: Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset.  Task 2: Checking missing values.  Task 3: Creating visual methods to analyze the data.  Task 4: make logistic regression model  Task 5: make Support vector machine classification model  Task 6: make KNN  model
